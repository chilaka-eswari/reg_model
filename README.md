Dynamic RAG with Groq, FAISS, and Llama3: Chat with your Documents

This project implements a dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system utilizing Groq, FAISS, and Llama3 models to enable interactive document-based question answering. Users can upload their PDF documents, and the system will analyze the content to generate accurate responses based on the information within the documents.

Features

Upload and Analyze PDFs: Upload your PDF documents for analysis and processing.

Interactive Chat Interface: Ask questions related to the uploaded documents, and get responses powered by advanced models.

Groq Integration: Utilizes Groqâ€™s powerful hardware to accelerate AI model inference.

FAISS: Uses FAISS to efficiently search the document's embeddings and retrieve the most relevant information.

Llama3 Model: Llama3 is leveraged to generate detailed answers based on the content of the documents.

How It Works

Upload Documents: Users can drag and drop their PDF files into the provided interface.

Process Documents: Once uploaded, the document is processed and analyzed.

Ask Questions: After processing, users can ask questions about the document.

Get Answers: The system fetches relevant information and generates answers using the combined power of Groq, FAISS, and Llama3.
